the degree of freedom in the rotational partition function has been provided because of tradition. It is not needed in any of the calculations or conversions.

<fieldset class='subpage' id='page_selectionrules' style='display:none'>

<div class='legend'>Remarks on the Selection Rules and Assignments</div>
<p>Strictly speaking, only the final quantum number <i>F</i>, which includes all effects of rotation etc. as well as electronic and nuclear spins, is a good one; meaning that it has a well-defined an unambiguous meaning. And this holds only in the absence of an electric or magnetic field. Mixing effects mediated by, e.&nbsp;g., vibration-, fine structure- (electronic spin), or hyperfine structure-rotation interaction (nuclear spins) frequently will prevent <i>N</i>, <i>K</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>J</i>, or <i>F<sub>i</sub></i> from being good quantum numbers in general. Of course, in many instances these quantum numbers are reasonably meaningful over a large range of quantum number combinations. Only the selection rule <b>&Delta;<i>F</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;&plusmn;1</b> holds strictly&nbsp;! Fine or hyperfine structure effects may cause mixing of levels having different values of <i>N</i>, <i>J</i>, etc., so that &Delta;<i>N</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;&plusmn;1 and &Delta;<i>J</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;&plusmn;1 only hold approximately&nbsp;! Note: certain hyperfine interactions can cause mixing of <i>ortho</i>- and <i>para</i>-levels&nbsp;! E.&nbsp;g. vibration-rotation interaction can cause mixing of different values of <i>K</i>. The strong transitions obey the selection rules &Delta;<i>F</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;=&nbsp;&Delta;<i>J</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;&Delta;<i>N</i>; for low values of <i>N</i>, other transitions may be comparatively strong.</p>

<p>The projections of the rotational angular momentum onto the <i>a</i>- and <i>c</i>-axes are described by the quantum numbers <i>K<sub>a</sub></i> and <i>K<sub>c</sub></i>. Usually <i>K<sub>c</sub></i>, not <i>K<sub>a</sub></i>, is the more meaningful quantum number for an oblate asymmetric rotor while <i>K<sub>a</sub></i> is more appropriate for a prolate rotor. For that reason, one may find <i>K<sub>p</sub></i> and <i>K<sub>o</sub></i> instead of <i>K<sub>a</sub></i> and <i>K<sub>c</sub></i>, respectively. For rotational levels near the oblate (prolate) limit, i.&nbsp;e. low (high) values of <i>K<sub>a</sub></i> and high (low) values of <i>K<sub>c</sub></i>, it is more useful to use <i>K<sub>c</sub></i> (<i>K<sub>a</sub></i>) as the designated <i>K</i> even if the molecule is a prolate (oblate) rotor&nbsp;!</p>

<p>The <b><i>a</i>-type</b> transitions are described by &Delta;<i>K<sub>a</sub></i>&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;0&nbsp;mod&nbsp;2 and &Delta;<i>K<sub>c</sub></i>&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;1&nbsp;mod&nbsp;2. Transitions with &Delta;<i>K<sub>a</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 are the strongest ones &ndash; by far so for a molecule close the the prolate limit, e.&nbsp;g. H<sub>2</sub>CO. The <b><i>c</i>-type</b> transitions are described analogously: &Delta;<i>K<sub>c</sub></i>&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;0&nbsp;mod&nbsp;2 and &Delta;<i>K<sub>a</sub></i>&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;1&nbsp;mod&nbsp;2. Again, transitions with &Delta;<i>K<sub>c</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 are the strongest ones &ndash; by far so for a molecule close the the oblate limit. Both <i>a</i>- and <i>c</i>-type transitions do not conserve the parity. The <b><i>b</i>-type</b> transitions are described by &Delta;<i>K<sub>a</sub></i>&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;1&nbsp;mod&nbsp;2 and &Delta;<i>K<sub>c</sub></i>&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;1&nbsp;mod&nbsp;2; these do conserve the parity. And again, transitions with &Delta;<i>K<sub>a</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and &Delta;<i>K<sub>c</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 are the strongest ones &ndash; by far so for a molecule close the the prolate and oblate limit, respectively. <font color="#ff0040"><b>NOTE:</b></font> Mixing effects will cause these selection rules to hold only approximately&nbsp;! In other words: a molecule with, e.&nbsp;g., only <i>b</i>-type selection rules may have transitions obeying other selection rules in its spectrum in the presence of mixing effects. Morever, mixing effects may lead to so-called <b><i>x</i>-type</b> transitions in the spectrum. These are described by &Delta;<i>K<sub>c</sub></i>&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;0&nbsp;mod&nbsp;2 and &Delta;<i>K<sub>a</sub></i>&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;0&nbsp;mod&nbsp;2. Obviously, these transitions are also parity conserving.</p>

<p>The assignment of quantum numbers may seem to be a straightforward issue. While this is true in many simple systems this is <font color="#ff0040"><b>not</b></font> the case in general&nbsp;!! Mixing effects are model-dependent, and in extreme cases the assignment of certain levels can be altered based on very small changes in the parameter &ndash; even more so if the parameter set is different.</p>
<p>The assignment of, e.&nbsp;g., <i>K</i> quantum numbers is not always unique. To avoid assignment of one quantum number to more than one state, quantum numbers are assigned to levels in the order of increasing ambiguity.</p>
<p>The presence of more than one non-zero spin will cause assignment ambiguities. To minimize these assignment ambiguities, certain rules apply how the various spin-angular momenta are coupled to the rotational angular momentum. Usually, they are coupled in order of decreasing size. <font color="#ff0040"><b>Exception:</b></font> one set of equivalent nuclear spin-angular momenta is coupled to the combined spin-rotational angular momentum last. The same applies if two different spin-angular momenta are coupled together before they are coupled to the combined spin-rotational angular momentum. Thus, the electronic spin-angular momentum is usually coupled to the rotation first. <font color="#ff0040"><b>Exception:</b></font> if the effects of the nuclear spin-electron spin coupling are larger than the effects caused by the electronic spin alone. This may happen in particular in some radicals with &Sigma; electronic state, e.&nbsp;g. in <sup>13</sup>CN, the order of the spins is <sup>13</sup>C, electron, <sup>14</sup>N. Quantum number assignments <font color="#ff0040"><b>always</b></font> refer to Hund's case (b). Alternative assignments may be available as non-default in the future.</p>

<fieldset class='subpage' id='page_reliability' style='display:none'>
<div class='legend'>Comments on the Reliability of the Predictions</div>

<p>The predicted uncertainties of the transition frequencies are model dependent. Therefore, an additional parameter employed in the fit will cause these to increase in general. Basically for the same reason, extrapolations should always be viewed with some caution since these may be affected by spectroscopic parameters that could not be determined thus far. In contrast, interpolations should be reliable in most instances.</p>
<p>If a large number of transition frequencies has been measured and is included in a fit the predicted uncertainties can be much smaller than the experimental uncertainties for a large range of quantum numbers. One should keep in mind that these smaller uncertainties are only meaningful if the experimental uncertainties are caused by purely statistical effects. For that matter, the predictions in the CDMS catalog have experimental transition frequencies and uncertainties nerged into the catalog file to indicate a more conservative means.</p>
<p>Recent catalog entries often contain some estimates as to how far the predictions should be reliable. Here &quot;reliable&quot; means that the transition frequencies should be found within three to ten times the predicted uncertainties.</p>
</fieldset>

<fieldset class='subpage' id='page_pf' style='display:none'>
<div class='legend'>Remarks on the Partition Function</div>

<p>The partition function <i>Q</i> is very important to calculate intensities of molecular lines at a given temperature. In general, only data for the ground vibrational state have been considered in the calculation of <i>Q</i> for a certain species. If excited vibrational states have been taken into account this will be mentioned in the documentation. Usually, individual contributions of the vibrational states are given in the documentation, too, or a link is given to a separate file containing the information.</p>
<p>Spin-statistical weight-ratios have been considered in most instances. <font color="#f00050"><b>NOTE:</b></font> Common factors have been devided off in order to keep <i>Q</i> and <i>g<sub>up</sub></i> small. Therefore, it is strongly advizable to compare <i>Q</i>/<i>g<sub>up</sub></i> rather than <i>Q</i> from various databases. Non-trivial spin-statistical weight ratios are given explicitely in the documentation of a given species. Spin-statistical weight-ratios are the prime reason for <i>Q</i> values of different isotopomers to be quite different on occasion. Other reasons may be that the number of vibrational states considered differ substantially.</p>

<p>In very cold regions of the ISM it may be important to consider <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> states separately. The energy of the lowest rotational or rotation-hyperfine level is 0 by default. The energy of the lowest level for the other spin-modification(s) is usually given in the documentation. Strictly speaking, one should consider <i>Q</i> values for the different spin-modifications separately &ndash; at least at low temperatures. We intend to provide this information in the near future.</p>
