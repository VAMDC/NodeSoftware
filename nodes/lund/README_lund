The Lund VAMDC node is running on the gunicorn webserver, 
load-balanced and fed to the net through a nginx proxy server on ports 8080 and 8888. 

http://pc228.astro.lu.se:8080/node/lund/tap

mysql user name is lund, database name is lund. 

Starting the node
-----------------

To start the node, both gunicorn and nginx needs to be started. 

From nodes/lund, run

gunicorn -c gunicorn.conf

followed by 

sudo /etc/init.d nginx start

- Updating the node software
----------------------------

git commit -a
<write commit message>

git pull upstream master


- Adding new data
-----------------

Add new updated refereces.dat, transitions.dat species.dat to /nodes/lund/

From /nodes/lund, erase the old database (this is easiest as long as data files are consistent): 
./manage.py reset node 

erase eventual old *.in files in nodes/lund

cd ../../imptools (you have to be in this dir to run the next command)

./run_rewrite ../../mapping_lund.py (or mapping_lund_singlestates.py)

cd ../nodes/lund 

mysql -D lund -u lund -p < load.sql

Restart the server: 

killall gunicorn 

gunicorn -c gunicorn.conf
