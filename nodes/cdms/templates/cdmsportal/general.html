   <p>
     The CDMS database contains a catalog of transition frequencies
     and state energies for atoms and molecules of astrophysical and
     atmospheric interest.

     The relevant laboratory data on these molecules is scattered over
     many journals and very many issues, and the CDMS has the purpose
     to provide the relevant data to the astronomical and
     spectroscopical community in a standardized way. Generally,
     emphasis has been put on creating new or updated entries taking
     into account particularly the submillimeter and terahertz
     regions.
   </p>
   <p>
     The entries are not restricted to species already observed in the
     ISM or CSM, but also include molecules that may be found there in
     the future. Therefore, the catalog can be, and has been used to
     identify new molecules in space. At present, the catalog covers
     mostly rotational transitions from the radio-frequency to the
     terahertz region and lower mid-infrared region, i.e. frequencies
     lower than ~18 THz or ~600 cm<sup>-1</sup>, or wavelengths longer
     than ~16.5 &mu;m.
   </p>
   <p>
     Vibration-rotation transitions in the far-infrared region have
     been included for C<sub>3</sub>. They may be included in a
     greater number in the near future. Vibration-rotation transitions
     in the mid-infrared region are currently not considered to be
     included in the database. If there is a genuine interest for such
     information to be included in our database please sent us
     comments and suggestions in order to suggest species. Information
     on background literature is desirable !!
   </p>
   <p>
     CDMS is part of the Virtual Atomic and Molecular Datacenter
     (VAMDC) and thus supports all its standards. <br><a>[more...]</a>

  <div class='legend'>Description of the CATALOG section of this Web-Portal</div>
  <p>
    The catalog section of this web portal gives access to all the data available in the catalog. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Data such as listings of transitions and states is
    provided through a query form, which allows to specify
    restrictions on the returned data, e.g. specify a frequency range.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, there is a documentation for each species which contains 
    <ul>
      <li>general informations such as a description of the data</li>
      <li>important molecular constants</li>
      <li>partition functions</li>
      <li>references</li>
      <li>links to information available in other databases</li>
      <li>download section for files</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The catalog section starts with a listing of species, which
    contains all the species available in CDMS. A link named <cite>doc</cite> guides
    the user directly to the documentation of the species specified in
    the table row.
  </p>
  <p>
    To access the query form, the user has to select the species of
    interest via mouse clicks (one or multiple) first and confirm the
    selection with the corresponding submit-button.  The selection can
    also be done on the level of isotopologs or molecules. Pressing
    one of the buttons above the listing will change the listing
    correspondingly. Thus, if the level of molecules has been chosen,
    the listing will show all the different molecules in the database
    and queries will restrict the data output to all species of the
    selected molecule.
  </p>
  <p>
    The query form offers the possibility to submit queries also to
    all databases in the VAMDC network if chosen in the
    DATABASE-Select box. Results from other databases is only obtained
    if selections on the level of isotopologs or molecules have been
    defined. Species define concrete entries (compilations) in CDMS
    and thus only data from CDMS is returned by the network.
  </p>
  <p>
    Further refinements on the query such as frequency range, can be
    specified in the corresponding REFINEMENTS section. The page also
    shows a short summary of data found in the databases for the given
    query. Hit the SHOW-button to view the complete result. Different
    output formats can be chosen.

<fieldset class='subpage' id='page_selectionrules' style='display:none'>
  <div class='legend'>Remarks on the Selection Rules</div>
  <p>
    Strictly speaking, only the final quantum number <i>F</i>, which
    includes all effects of rotation etc. as well as electronic and
    nuclear spins, is a good one; meaning that it has a well-defined
    an unambiguous meaning. And this holds only in the absence of an
    electric or magnetic field. Mixing effects mediated by,
    e.&nbsp;g., vibration-, fine structure- (electronic spin), or
    hyperfine structure-rotation interaction (nuclear spins)
    frequently will prevent <i>N</i>, <i>K</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>J</i>, or
    <i>F<sub>i</sub></i> from being good quantum numbers in
    general. Of course, in many instances these quantum numbers are
    reasonably meaningful over a large range of quantum number
    combinations. Only the selection rule
    <b>&Delta;<i>F</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;&plusmn;1</b> holds
    strictly&nbsp;! Fine or hyperfine structure effects may cause
    mixing of levels having different values of <i>N</i>, <i>J</i>,
    etc., so that &Delta;<i>N</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;&plusmn;1 and
    &Delta;<i>J</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;&plusmn;1 only hold
    approximately&nbsp;! Note: certain hyperfine interactions can
    cause mixing of <i>ortho</i>- and <i>para</i>-levels&nbsp;! 
    E.&nbsp;g. vibration-rotation interaction can cause mixing of
    different values of <i>K</i>. The strong transitions obey the
    selection rules
    &Delta;<i>F</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;=&nbsp;&Delta;<i>J</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;&Delta;<i>N</i>;
    for low values of <i>N</i>, other transitions may be comparatively
    strong.
  </p>
  <p>
    The projections of the rotational angular momentum onto the
    <i>a</i>- and <i>c</i>-axes are described by the quantum numbers
    <i>K<sub>a</sub></i> and <i>K<sub>c</sub></i>. Usually
    <i>K<sub>c</sub></i>, not <i>K<sub>a</sub></i>, is the more
    meaningful quantum number for an oblate asymmetric rotor while
    <i>K<sub>a</sub></i> is more appropriate for a prolate rotor. For
    that reason, one may find <i>K<sub>p</sub></i> and
    <i>K<sub>o</sub></i> instead of <i>K<sub>a</sub></i> and
    <i>K<sub>c</sub></i>, respectively. For rotational levels near the
    oblate (prolate) limit, i.&nbsp;e. low (high) values of
    <i>K<sub>a</sub></i> and high (low) values of
    <i>K<sub>c</sub></i>, it is more useful to use
    <i>K<sub>c</sub></i> (<i>K<sub>a</sub></i>) as the designated
    <i>K</i> even if the molecule is a prolate (oblate)
    rotor&nbsp;!
  </p>
  <p>
    The <b><i>a</i>-type</b> transitions are described by
    &Delta;<i>K<sub>a</sub></i>&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;0&nbsp;mod&nbsp;2
    and
    &Delta;<i>K<sub>c</sub></i>&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;1&nbsp;mod&nbsp;2. Transitions
    with &Delta;<i>K<sub>a</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 are the strongest
    ones &ndash; by far so for a molecule close the the prolate limit,
    e.&nbsp;g. H<sub>2</sub>CO. The <b><i>c</i>-type</b> transitions
    are described analogously:
    &Delta;<i>K<sub>c</sub></i>&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;0&nbsp;mod&nbsp;2
    and
    &Delta;<i>K<sub>a</sub></i>&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;1&nbsp;mod&nbsp;2. Again,
    transitions with &Delta;<i>K<sub>c</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 are the
    strongest ones &ndash; by far so for a molecule close the the
    oblate limit. Both <i>a</i>- and <i>c</i>-type transitions do not
    conserve the parity. The <b><i>b</i>-type</b> transitions are
    described by
    &Delta;<i>K<sub>a</sub></i>&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;1&nbsp;mod&nbsp;2
    and
    &Delta;<i>K<sub>c</sub></i>&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;1&nbsp;mod&nbsp;2;
    these do conserve the parity. And again, transitions with
    &Delta;<i>K<sub>a</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and
    &Delta;<i>K<sub>c</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 are the strongest ones
    &ndash; by far so for a molecule close the the prolate and oblate
    limit, respectively. 
    <div class="info">
      <b>NOTE:</b><br/> Mixing effects will cause these selection
      rules to hold only approximately&nbsp;! In other words: a
      molecule with, e.&nbsp;g., only <i>b</i>-type selection rules
      may have transitions obeying other selection rules in its
      spectrum in the presence of mixing effects. Morever, mixing
      effects may lead to so-called <b><i>x</i>-type</b> transitions
      in the spectrum. These are described by
      &Delta;<i>K<sub>c</sub></i>&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;0&nbsp;mod&nbsp;2
      and
      &Delta;<i>K<sub>a</sub></i>&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;0&nbsp;mod&nbsp;2. Obviously,
      these transitions are also parity conserving.

<fieldset class='subpage' id='page_assignments' style='display:none'>
  <div class='legend'>Remarks on the Assignments</div>
  <p>
    The assignment of quantum numbers may seem to be a straightforward
    issue. While this is true in many simple systems this is
    <b>not</b> the case in general&nbsp;!! Mixing effects are
    model-dependent, and in extreme cases the assignment of certain
    levels can be altered based on very small changes in the parameter
    &ndash; even more so if the parameter set is different.</p> <p>The
    assignment of, e.&nbsp;g., <i>K</i> quantum numbers is not always
    unique. To avoid assignment of one quantum number to more than one
    state, quantum numbers are assigned to levels in the order of
    increasing ambiguity.</p> <p>The presence of more than one
    non-zero spin will cause assignment ambiguities. To minimize these
    assignment ambiguities, certain rules apply how the various
    spin-angular momenta are coupled to the rotational angular
    momentum. Usually, they are coupled in order of decreasing
    size. <b>Exception:</b> one set of equivalent nuclear spin-angular
    momenta is coupled to the combined spin-rotational angular
    momentum last. The same applies if two different spin-angular
    momenta are coupled together before they are coupled to the
    combined spin-rotational angular momentum. Thus, the electronic
    spin-angular momentum is usually coupled to the rotation
    first. <b>Exception:</b> if the effects of the nuclear
    spin-electron spin coupling are larger than the effects caused by
    the electronic spin alone. This may happen in particular in some
    radicals with &Sigma; electronic state, e.&nbsp;g. in
    <sup>13</sup>CN, the order of the spins is <sup>13</sup>C,
    electron, <sup>14</sup>N. Quantum number assignments <b>always</b>
    refer to Hund's case (b). Alternative assignments may be available
    as non-default in the future.

  <div class='legend'>Query the catalog</div>
  <p>
    CDMS offers different ways how catalog data can be searched and
    accessed. Probably, the easiest way is through this webportal or
    alternatively through VAMDC's portal at (http://portal.vamdc.eu).
  </p>
  <p>
    Alternatively, every software, e.g. web-browsers, which can send
    http-requests, can be used and data can be retrieved just by
    formulating the data request as an URL string. The data will be
    returned as XML-file. Please have a look at the VAMDC standards
    section for more information.

<fieldset class='subpage' id='page_reliability' style='display:none'>
  <div class='legend'>Comments on the Reliability of the Predictions</div>
  <p>
    The predicted uncertainties of the transition frequencies are
    model dependent. Therefore, an additional parameter employed in
    the fit will cause these to increase in general. Basically for the
    same reason, extrapolations should always be viewed with some
    caution since these may be affected by spectroscopic parameters
    that could not be determined thus far. In contrast, interpolations
    should be reliable in most instances.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a large number of transition frequencies has been measured and
    is included in a fit the predicted uncertainties can be much
    smaller than the experimental uncertainties for a large range of
    quantum numbers. One should keep in mind that these smaller
    uncertainties are only meaningful if the experimental
    uncertainties are caused by purely statistical effects. For that
    matter, the predictions in the CDMS catalog have experimental
    transition frequencies and uncertainties nerged into the catalog
    file to indicate a more conservative means.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recent catalog entries often contain some estimates as to how far
    the predictions should be reliable. Here &quot;reliable&quot;
    means that the transition frequencies should be found within three
    to ten times the predicted uncertainties.

<fieldset class='subpage' id='page_pf' style='display:none'>
  <div class='legend'>Remarks on the Partition Function</div>
  <p>
    The partition function <i>Q</i> is very important to calculate
    intensities of molecular lines at a given temperature. In general,
    only data for the ground vibrational state have been considered in
    the calculation of <i>Q</i> for a certain species. If excited
    vibrational states have been taken into account this will be
    mentioned in the documentation. Usually, individual contributions
    of the vibrational states are given in the documentation, too, or
    a link is given to a separate file containing the information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Spin-statistical weight-ratios have been considered in most
    instances. 
    <div class="info">
      <b>NOTE:</b> Common factors have been devided off in order to
      keep <i>Q</i> and <i>g<sub>up</sub></i> small. Therefore, it is
      strongly advizable to compare <i>Q</i>/<i>g<sub>up</sub></i>
      rather than <i>Q</i> from various databases. Non-trivial
      spin-statistical weight ratios are given explicitely in the
      documentation of a given species. Spin-statistical weight-ratios
      are the prime reason for <i>Q</i> values of different
      isotopomers to be quite different on occasion. Other reasons may
      be that the number of vibrational states considered differ
      substantially.
    </div>
  </p>
  <p>
    In very cold regions of the ISM it may be important to consider
    <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> states separately. The energy of the
    lowest rotational or rotation-hyperfine level is 0 by default. The
    energy of the lowest level for the other spin-modification(s) is
    usually given in the documentation. Strictly speaking, one should
    consider <i>Q</i> values for the different spin-modifications
    separately &ndash; at least at low temperatures. We intend to
    provide this information in the near future.

  <div class='legend'>VAMDC standards</div> 
  <p>
    CDMS supports the standards defined by VAMDC. Please have a look
    at <a
    href="http://www.vamdc.eu/documents/standards/">http://www.vamdc.eu/documents/standards/</a>
    for detailed information.
  </p>
  <p>
    All databases in the VAMDC network can be queried simply via
    http-request. Thus every simple web-browser is capable of sending
    data request to the databases in retrieve the result just by
    formulating the request as a URL and a XML-file will be
    returned. Within the VAMDC standards it is defined how the URL
    string has to be formulated and how the returned XML-file will
    look like.

    Most importantly, a protocol for data-access (VAMDC-TAP), a common
    query language (VSS2), and a common output format (VAMDC-XSAMS)
    have been defined.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>VAMDC-TAP</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    is a protocol for data-access services that provide the common
    table model matching VAMDC-XSAMS and which can return the results
    of queries in VAMDC-XSAMS. It is based on IVOA's Table Access
    Protocol (TAP), which already provides virtual data and allows to
    plug in the query language VSS2 and the data model VAMDC-XSAMS.
  </p>
  <p>
    VAMDC-TAP is defined as a web-service protocol. That means that
    VAMDC-TAP services are driven by GET and POST requests to HTTP (or
    HTTPS) URIs.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Example:</i>
    <div class="info">
http://cdms.ph1.uni-koeln.de/cdms/tap/sync?LANG=VSS2&REQUEST=doQuery&FORMAT=XSAMS&QUERY=SELECT+All+WHERE+MoleculeStoichiometricFormula='H2O'
</div>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>VSS2</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    VAMDC SQL Subset 2 (VSS2) is a query language designed for the
    VAMDC-TAP web-services. It specifies how queries to VAMDC
    databases have to be formulated.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Example:</i>
    <div class="info">SELECT All WHERE MoleculeStoichiometricFormula = "H2O"</div>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>VAMDC-XSAMS</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    The VAMDC-XSAMS standard defines the data exchange format which is
    used by VAMDC databases. All databases within the VAMDC network
    will return data as XML file according to this standard.
  </p>
  <p>
    Started with the International Atomic
    Energy Agency's XML Schema for Atomic, Molecular and Solid Data
    (XSAMS) version 0.1.1 [XSAMS], VAMDC consortium has found that
    modifications/additions were necessary in order to meet the needs
    of implementation and queries. This effort has resulted in the
    so-called VAMDC-XSAMS schema that is used within VAMDC.
