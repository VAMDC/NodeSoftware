A quick implementation of a mini-VAMDC, for test purposes.

USAGE:
* Check out your copy with "git clone git://github.com/ivh/VAMDC-VALD.git"
* Change directory into VAMDC-VALD.
* Run "./import.py dummy" to create dummy data with corresponding
  config file.
* Run "./server.py" to start the server on localhost:8080.
* Run "./request.py" to send a request to the server and
  get the answer back (JSON encoded), unpack the data and
  print it.

DESCRIPTION:
Uses the built-in Python libraries for 
 * Webserver
 * URL retrieval with POST data
 * JSON data format
 * SQLite database
these scripts emulate the communication principle between
VAMDC and a data provider database, i.e. a request is sent
over http to the server, which anwsers it from the database
that was created from the import.

TODO:
import.py:
 * Come up with a format in the config files for connecting
   tables and specify indices
 * add format descriptions for the columns
 * treat empty fields, quotes in data etc.
 * create tables for metadata, registry
 * make it robust, testing

server.py
 * add authentication
 * make requests more TAP-like
 * implement registry request
 * maybe switch to a higher level framework, like cherrypy or web2py
 * implement alternative to SQLite: use MySQL

In general:
 * import the whole of VALD and run performance tests
